### 🦠 Level 4: Emergent Behavior
Complex patterns arise from simple rules.
*   **Mechanic:**
    *   **Collision:** Touching words merge into MEGA-WORDS.
    *   **Infection:** Unstable words spread glitches.
    *   **Goal:** Trigger a collision, form a Mega-Word, and pop it.
    *   **Warning:** Too many words = System Saturation.
